# multi-lang-android-app

A sample Android App, write with multi languages (Java and Rust), demonstrating a new development method.

This method is: communicating between threads that written in defferent languages.

Thus you can throw away the C-ABI and FFI interfaces, doing things what you want freely.

Using Apache Arrow [https://github.com/apache/arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow) to exchange data between Java and Rust.
